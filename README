This software is a fork of xfce4-power-manager for the Xfce desktop in which I have restored the tray
icon functionality from 1.2.0 and earlier.

I accomplished this through reverting relevant changes and blindly debugging the fallout, so BE
WARNED, this software (this fork) may do bad things.

As far as I can tell, everything should work like it used to for now. Future changes may be more
difficult to integrate but perhaps I will try.

P.S. to build, something like this would do (fiddle with flags as you like):

$ ./autogen.sh --prefix=/usr --disable-static --enable-network-manager --enable-polkit --disable-debug
$ make
$ make install

Original README follows...

What is it?
===========

Xfce power manager manages the power sources on the computer and the devices that can be controlled
to reduce their power consumption (such as LCD brightness level, monitor sleep). 

In addition, xfce4-power-manager provides a set of freedesktop-compliant DBus interfaces to 
inform other applications about current power level so that they can adjust their power consumption.
